### rems-intermediary
Mock intermediary system to model stakeholder in workflow demo. See [rems-setup guide](https://github.com/mcode/rems-setup) for more information on the project. 

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3003](http://localhost:3003) with your browser to see the result.


## Running the Mongo DB instance

The REMS intermediary relies on MongoDB for it's backing database.
Follow the mongodb setup instructions in the [REMS End to End Setup Guide](https://github.com/mcode/rems-setup/blob/main/EndToEndSetupGuide.md#mongodb).

If you would rather run with docker, follow the setup found in the [REMS Simple Setup Guide](https://github.com/mcode/rems-setup/blob/main/SimpleSetupGuide.md) (this will also setup the other REMS applications in docker as well).
